========

If I tweet at you late at night with one word, `ruby_mdb`, please
send help. This rabbit hole bears not the consideration of daylight
or soberness, and may like the vision of some elder god invoke a
lasting form of madness.

Pull requests welcome.

## Usage

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant zlogin
git clone https://github.com/sax/ruby_mdb
cd ruby_mdb
./setup.sh
```

* I will buy you a beer, or spirits, or a pony. I get to choose.
* Seriously, I will hug the shit out of you if you help me make
  this work
